            This is for a project grade. With that said, these are my genuine opinions of the best 
            pies for the holiday. I make references to a previous list, and that's because I made a 
            top ten list 2 years ago. And yes, I really do care about pies this much! None of the pies 
            on the actual list are bad by any means, and are all alright options for the holiday 
            season. I really do hope you enjoyed reading through this silly little thing, and found 
            my opinions insightful. Or at the very least, humorous. Thank you, have a good one, and be well!
