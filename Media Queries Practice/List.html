            <p>
                This is an alright pie, and would be an interesting surprise if you were
                to bring one to a party. I just feel like it's too sweet and "pastry-like" 
                for my taste, although, I'd still enjoy a slice from time to time.

            <p>
                Soild pie. Very rich and creamy in it's flavor. Only if you can get behind 
                that lime taste. I think its quite pleasant, but I understand where people are
                coming from when they say they don't like it. Not the best choice for the Holidays.

            <p>
                Slightly better choice for a Holiday party than the Key Lime. The flavor is more 
                pronounced too! And more tart! If you don't like tart pies, then this won't be your 
                thing, unfortunately.

            <p>
                A classic pie! Rich and gooey, the chery flavor hits like a punch. A good o'l, 
                reliable flavor. You won't go wrong bringing this pie to a party. But, the point still 
                stands: there are better options to choose from.

            <p>
                Another classic pick! Dark in color and super sweet. That blueberry taste just makes 
                for a better holiday pie then the cherry. Just make sure to be careful while eating it. 
                Those dark blue-purple blueberry stains on your holiday clothes will not make for a good 
                end to the year.

            <p>
                Not a sweet fruit pie, but a savory pie instead! Makes for a great addition to 
                your New Years and Christmas dinners. The beef is saucy and flavorful, and 
                vegetables with pie crust make an amazing flavor profile.

                Pumpkin pie makes for an amazing Holiday, even past Thanksgiving. 
                Smooth and spiceful. Could never go wronge with it!

            <p>
                Incredibly important and very useful for visualizing data.
                Very professional indeed! Not very holiday related in most applications, 
                however. And not edible, to my knowledge.

            <p>
                Not a "True" pie, since it is made with potatoes. Earns a spot 
                here because it's preaty good. Tasty, savory, and a hearty meal!

            <p>
                I myself am deadly allergic to tree nuts, so I can't say I've had it 
                before. However, I have heard from others that it is an amazing pie when 
                done right! Definitely give it a try, if it doesn't kill you.

                I had to do it. Pizza durring the holiday goes hard. That is a fact.
                Eating a warm slice on a cold winter's night, sharing time with your family. 
                Places 3rd on this list.

            <p>
                The humble apple pie is an absolute staple in the pie world. for most people
                when they heard the word "Pie", they this of this. And for good reason too! 
                Crispy, scrumcious, flavorful, and sometimes spiceful, it would be criminal 
                if this classic pie wasn't on the list! It places 2nd on this list.

            <p>
                I ranked this pie first last time, and it still hasn't changed. 
                I love this pie to bits! Creamy, savory, and delicious! If you haven't
                had this pie yet, you NEED to try it one day. Especially if you are a 
                big fan of chicken. Share it with family during Holiday gatherings, and if it's 
                a good one, they are sure to love it!
